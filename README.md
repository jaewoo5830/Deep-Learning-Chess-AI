# Deep-Learning-Chess-AI
- Developed an artificial intelligence algorithm to find the most ideal move in any given chess positions and presented the model to the 1200 undergraduate engineering students at the University of Michigan
- Used Piece Square Table to create the deep learning architecture and combined it with Minimax algorithm
- Optimized the algorithm by 86% by applying Alpha-Beta pruning algorithm to the model
